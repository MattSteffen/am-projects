- K-Means Clustering

## 1. Standard Vector Search (Brute-Force)

Algorithm Description:
Standard Vector Search, also known as brute-force search, is the simplest form of vector search. It involves comparing the query vector with every vector in the dataset to find the most similar ones. Similarity is typically measured using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

Pseudocode:

```
function standard_vector_search(query_vector, dataset, k):
    distances = []
    for each vector in dataset:
        distance = calculate_distance(query_vector, vector)
        distances.append((distance, vector))
    sort distances in ascending order
    return first k elements of distances
```

Examples and Use Cases:
The standard vector search can be applied to various scenarios, such as:

1. Finding similar images in a database based on their feature vectors.
2. Recommending products to users based on their preference vectors.
3. Identifying nearest neighbors in a geographical dataset.

Analysis:

- Computational Complexity: O(n \* d), where n is the number of vectors in the dataset and d is the dimensionality of the vectors.
- Advantages: Simple to implement and understand. Guarantees finding the exact nearest neighbors.
- Disadvantages: Slow for large datasets. Not scalable for high-dimensional data or real-time applications.
- Potential Improvements: Implement parallel processing to speed up comparisons. Use approximate methods for larger datasets.

## 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Algorithm Description:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, versatile algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of vector search, KNN finds the k closest data points to a given query point based on a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance).

Pseudocode:

```
function knn_search(query_vector, dataset, k):
    distances = []
    for each vector in dataset:
        distance = calculate_distance(query_vector, vector)
        distances.append((distance, vector))
    sort distances in ascending order
    return first k elements of distances

function knn_classify(query_vector, dataset, labels, k):
    neighbors = knn_search(query_vector, dataset, k)
    neighbor_labels = get labels of neighbors
    return most common label in neighbor_labels
```

Examples and Use Cases:
KNN can be applied to various scenarios, including:

1. Image classification based on feature vectors.
2. Recommender systems for finding similar items or users.
3. Anomaly detection by identifying data points with few nearby neighbors.

Analysis:

- Computational Complexity: O(n \* d) for search, where n is the number of vectors in the dataset and d is the dimensionality of the vectors.
- Advantages: Simple to implement and understand. No training phase required. Works well for multi-class problems.
- Disadvantages: Slow for large datasets. Sensitive to the scale of features. The choice of k can significantly affect results.
- Potential Improvements: Use spatial data structures like KD-trees or Ball-trees to speed up neighbor search. Implement weighted KNN for better classification accuracy.

## 3. K-Means Clustering

Algorithm Description:
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). In the context of vector search, K-Means can be used as a preprocessing step to group similar vectors, potentially speeding up the search process.

Pseudocode:

```
function kmeans_clustering(dataset, k, max_iterations):
    randomly initialize k centroids
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        assign each data point to the nearest centroid
        update centroids as the mean of assigned points
        if centroids haven't changed significantly:
            break
    return centroids, cluster_assignments

function kmeans_search(query_vector, dataset, centroids, cluster_assignments, k):
    nearest_centroid = find_nearest_centroid(query_vector, centroids)
    cluster_points = get_points_in_cluster(dataset, cluster_assignments, nearest_centroid)
    return knn_search(query_vector, cluster_points, k)
```

        store cluster centroids
    return centroids

function encode_vectors(vectors, centroids):
    for each vector:
        split vector into subvectors
        for each subvector:
            find nearest centroid
            store centroid index
    return encoded vectors

function faiss_like_search(query_vector, dataset, encoded_dataset, centroids, k):
    encode query_vector using centroids
    compute distances between encoded query and encoded dataset

    encoded_vectors = []
    for each vector in vectors:
        leaf = find_leaf(vector, build_tree)
        encoded = quantize_vector(vector, quantizers[leaf])
        encoded_vectors.append((leaf, encoded))
    return encoded_vectors

function scann_search(query_vector, dataset, encoded_dataset, build_tree, quantizers, k):
    query_leaf = find_leaf(query_vector, build_tree)
    candidate_leaves = find_nearby_leaves(query_leaf, build_tree)
    candidates = []
    for leaf in candidate_leaves:
        leaf_candidates = get_vectors_in_leaf(encoded_dataset, leaf)
        candidates.extend(leaf_candidates)
    distances = compute_approx_distances(query_vector, candidates, quantizers)
    return k vectors with smallest distances
```

Examples and Use Cases:
ScaNN is particularly useful for large-scale similarity search tasks, such as:

1. Similarity search in recommendation systems for products, music, or videos.
2. Efficient nearest neighbor search in machine learning pipelines.

Algorithm Description:
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is a graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search. It constructs a multi-layer graph structure where each layer is a "navigable small world" graph. The search process starts at the top layer and progressively moves down to lower layers, refining the search at each step.

    graph = initialize_empty_graph()
    for each vector in dataset:
        insert_point(vector, graph, M, ef_construction)
    return graph

function insert_point(point, graph, M, ef_construction):
    entry_point = get_random_entry_point(graph)
    for layer in reverse(graph.layers):
        neighbors = search_layer(point, entry_point, ef_construction, layer)
        connect_point_to_neighbors(point, neighbors, M, layer)
        entry_point = get_closest_neighbor(neighbors)

function hnsw_search(query_vector, graph, ef_search, k):
    entry_point = graph.top_layer_entry_point
    for layer in reverse(graph.layers):
        neighbors = search_layer(query_vector, entry_point, ef_search, layer)
        entry_point = get_closest_neighbor(neighbors)

## 4. PQ (Product Quantization) Encoding

Algorithm Description:
Product Quantization (PQ) is a technique used to compress high-dimensional vectors into compact codes. It divides the original vector space into subspaces and quantizes each subspace separately. This allows for efficient storage and fast approximate distance computations.

Pseudocode:

```
function train_product_quantizer(dataset, M, K):
    split dataset vectors into M subvectors
    for each subvector space:

        codebooks.append(centroids)
    return codebooks

function encode_vectors_pq(vectors, codebooks):
    encoded_vectors = []
    for each vector in vectors:
        split vector into M subvectors
        encoded = []
        for i, subvector in enumerate(subvectors):
            nearest_centroid_index = find_nearest_centroid(subvector, codebooks[i])
            encoded.append(nearest_centroid_index)
        encoded_vectors.append(encoded)
    return encoded_vectors
