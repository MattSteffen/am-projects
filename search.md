# Naive Search

## 1. Standard Vector Search (Brute-Force)

Algorithm Description:
Standard Vector Search, also known as brute-force search, is the simplest form of vector search. It involves comparing the query vector with every vector in the dataset to find the most similar ones. Similarity is typically measured using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

Pseudocode:

```
function standard_vector_search(query_vector, dataset, k):
    distances = []
    for each vector in dataset:
        distance = calculate_distance(query_vector, vector)
        distances.append((distance, vector))
    sort distances in ascending order
    return first k elements of distances
```

Examples and Use Cases:
The standard vector search can be applied to various scenarios, such as:

1. Finding similar images in a database based on their feature vectors.
2. Recommending products to users based on their preference vectors.
3. Identifying nearest neighbors in a geographical dataset.

Analysis:

- Computational Complexity: O(n \* d), where n is the number of vectors in the dataset and d is the dimensionality of the vectors.
- Advantages: Simple to implement and understand. Guarantees finding the exact nearest neighbors.
- Disadvantages: Slow for large datasets. Not scalable for high-dimensional data or real-time applications.
- Potential Improvements: Implement parallel processing to speed up comparisons. Use approximate methods for larger datasets.

## 2. FAISS-like Vector Search

Algorithm Description:
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It uses techniques like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and indexing to speed up the search process. One of the key techniques used in FAISS is Product Quantization (PQ), which we'll implement in a simplified form.

Pseudocode:

```
function train_product_quantizer(dataset, n_subvectors, n_clusters):
    split dataset vectors into n_subvectors
    for each subvector:
        perform k-means clustering with n_clusters
        store cluster centroids
    return centroids

function encode_vectors(vectors, centroids):
    for each vector:
        split vector into subvectors
        for each subvector:
            find nearest centroid
            store centroid index
    return encoded vectors

function faiss_like_search(query_vector, dataset, encoded_dataset, centroids, k):
    encode query_vector using centroids
    compute distances between encoded query and encoded dataset
    return k vectors with smallest distances
```

Examples and Use Cases:
FAISS-like vector search is particularly useful in scenarios involving large-scale similarity search, such as:

1. Image retrieval systems for finding visually similar images in large databases.
2. Recommendation systems for quickly finding similar items or users.
3. Large-scale document retrieval based on semantic embeddings.

Analysis:

- Computational Complexity: O(n_subvectors \* n_clusters) for encoding, O(n) for search, where n is the number of vectors in the dataset.
- Advantages: Significantly faster than brute-force search for large datasets. Scalable to high-dimensional data.
- Disadvantages: Approximate results (may not always find the exact nearest neighbors). Requires a training phase.
- Potential Improvements: Implement more advanced indexing techniques like Inverted File System (IVF) for even faster search. Use GPU acceleration for faster computation.

##3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Algorithm Description:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, versatile algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of vector search, KNN finds the k closest data points to a given query point based on a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance).

Pseudocode:

```
function knn_search(query_vector, dataset, k):
    distances = []
    for each vector in dataset:
        distance = calculate_distance(query_vector, vector)
        distances.append((distance, vector))
    sort distances in ascending order
    return first k elements of distances

function knn_classify(query_vector, dataset, labels, k):
    neighbors = knn_search(query_vector, dataset, k)
    neighbor_labels = get labels of neighbors
    return most common label in neighbor_labels
```

Examples and Use Cases:
KNN can be applied to various scenarios, including:

1. Image classification based on feature vectors.
2. Recommender systems for finding similar items or users.
3. Anomaly detection by identifying data points with few nearby neighbors.

Analysis:

- Computational Complexity: O(n \* d) for search, where n is the number of vectors in the dataset and d is the dimensionality of the vectors.
- Advantages: Simple to implement and understand. No training phase required. Works well for multi-class problems.
- Disadvantages: Slow for large datasets. Sensitive to the scale of features. The choice of k can significantly affect results.
- Potential Improvements: Use spatial data structures like KD-trees or Ball-trees to speed up neighbor search. Implement weighted KNN for better classification accuracy.

## 4. K-Means Clustering

Algorithm Description:
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). In the context of vector search, K-Means can be used as a preprocessing step to group similar vectors, potentially speeding up the search process.

Pseudocode:

```
function kmeans_clustering(dataset, k, max_iterations):
    randomly initialize k centroids
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        assign each data point to the nearest centroid
        update centroids as the mean of assigned points
        if centroids haven't changed significantly:
            break
    return centroids, cluster_assignments

function kmeans_search(query_vector, dataset, centroids, cluster_assignments, k):
    nearest_centroid = find_nearest_centroid(query_vector, centroids)
    cluster_points = get_points_in_cluster(dataset, cluster_assignments, nearest_centroid)
    return knn_search(query_vector, cluster_points, k)
```
