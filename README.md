# am-projects

Applied Mathematics projects designed to keep me afloat in the realm of ML, NN, and Applied Math.

## TODO:

- [ ] General tasks:
  - [ ] Write benchmarks to compare them
  - [ ] Write up complexity analysis (storage, time)
  - [ ] Write up my own implementation
  - [ ] Code up open-source implementation and compare benchmarks
  - [ ] Use example set to make sure all implementations are correct
  - [ ] Write up use cases (when is it useful, what kind of data is it useful for)

## Search Algorithms

- [ ] Naive Search
  - [ ] Debug and confirm all naive search implementations
  - [ ] Algorithms: Brute-force, KNN, KMeans
- [ ] High Performance Search
  - [ ] ScaNN
  - [ ] Faiss
  - [ ] HNSW
  - [ ] PQ encoding
- [ ] Optimized search for huge datasets
  - [ ] PGVector
    - [ ] PGScale too
  - [ ] Faiss

## Clustering Algorithms

- [ ] Simple
  - [ ] Spectral clustering
  - [ ] KMeans clustering
  - [ ] Gaussian mixture models
  - [ ] OPTICS
  - [ ] HDBSCAN
  - [ ] Heirarchical clustering
- [ ] Advanced
  - [ ] PCA/UMAP + clustering
  - [ ] Autoencoders + clustering
  - [ ] Louvain community detection
  - [ ] Leiden algorithm
